# SQLAlchemy RDF Bridge

This package allows to define RDF mapping information
in the info fields of a SQLAlchemy data model, collect that
information by introspection, with the aim of generating mappings.

It is an extension of work presented as a poster at ISWC2014:
http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1272/paper_60.pdf

This library was originally developed for the [Assembl](https://github.com/assembl/assembl) project.
